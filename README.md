- ğŸ‘‹ ## Hi, I'm Djordje, 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programing in general, but of course, 
    since I did not study computer sciences, web development is easily available.  

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, React framework, NodeJs, a bit of devops caught my eye.. 
  And I'm very interested in backend development and since I've started tinckering with linux, 
  I was mindblown by the terminal and posibilites..

- ğŸ“« How to reach me ...
