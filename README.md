- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, I'm Djordje, ('George' is the english version) 
- ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m interested in programing in general, but of course, 
    since I did not study computer sciences, web development is my entry point.  

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning / developing with 
- ### JavaScript, 
- ### NodeJs,
- ### React framework,  
  And I'm very interested in backend development, and after I settle in with 
- ### TypeScript a bit, 
- ### Golang will be my next big time investment.

- a bit of devops stuff also caught my interest since I started tinkering with docker and Linux OS 
- a tiny bit of React Native 
- 
have used libraries (or whatever they are called): 
#### Redux
#### ReactQuery
#### GSAP (animations)
#### ThreeJS 

<br>
<br>
Fun fact: Music is my hobby (as every other's dev), I've been playing, singing, producing (for myself at least) for years..
